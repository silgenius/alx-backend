## Introduction

Caching is a technique used to store copies of files or data in a temporary storage location for quick access. The goal of caching is to reduce the time it takes to retrieve data and improve application performance. This project covers various caching mechanisms and their implementations.

## Objectives

- Understand the principles of caching.
- Implement different caching strategies.
- Analyze the performance benefits of caching.
- Explore practical use cases for caching in real-world applications.

## Technologies

This project is built using:

- Python (version 3.x)
- Redis for caching implementation
- Flask for creating a sample web application (if applicable)

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/0x01-caching.git
   ```
